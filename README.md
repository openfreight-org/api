**Setting A New Standard**

The initial OpenFreight standards were developed internally at Freightos and are already used by dozens of global organization. While they broadly focus on pricing, booking and documentation standards, the focus is rapidly expanding to full Track & Trace standards as well. Current standards include:

- Request For Spot Quote – request a price for a specific lane, load  type and mode
- Tariff  – prices for specific lanes, load types and modes
- Tender – an Excel file with list of lanes and goes back and forth between client and forwarder or carrier until there’s an agreement on pricing.
- Booking – book a shipment based on a specific RFQ, including two-way commitment, and all the shipment details (e.g. documents, consignee, consignor, commodity type, status)
- Track & Trace – request and response on shipment status, location, etc. (Coming shortly…)

These standards were rolled out in 2018 and continue to evolve with adoption and the growth of the OpenFreight community.  Updates will be posted on the website and emails informing of any updates will be sent to all who join the <a href="https://www.openfreight.org/openfreight-org-home-page/openfreight-community/" target="_blank">OpenFreight</a> Community.
